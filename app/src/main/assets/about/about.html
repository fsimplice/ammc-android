AMB tester software is unofficial software for testing AMB/MYLAPS sports timing devices. The software should
be compatible with AMBrc Decoder, MYLAPS RC4 Decoder, AMBmx3 Decoder, TranX3 Decoder, ChipX Decoder and BIB Decoder.
We have not tested with all these decoders. We are pleased if you let us know about any issues by email to
<a href="mailto:skokys@gmail.com">skokys@gmail.com</a>

<p>
    Because some older decoders connects using <u>serial cable</u>, these can only be connected with a tablet with
    serial port.
    If you do not have device with a serial port, check <a
        href="https://sites.google.com/site/ambmylapstester/raspberry-pi">RaspiTimingBox</a> - a device that converts
    from device to JSON on serial port as well.
</p>

<p>
    We recommend to use <u>ethernet-enabled device</u>. These can be connected
    to a WiFi router where typical Android device can be connected. See the connection schema.

</p>

<p>
    You can also <u>use USB port</u>, but your table must have USB host connector. Choose USB connection from the app to check.
</p>

<p>
    The tester connects to default port 5403. To connect to another port, type the port in the address filed like this
    IP:PORT, example: 192.168.1.1:5400

    An another application can use the P3 protocol parser on the same tablet. The application implements service that
    can be invoked from outside and response with parsed data Java way. If your application works on another platform,
    contact us for another supported platforms.
